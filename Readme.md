# WinForms Lookup - Create cascading lookup editors 

`LookUpEdit`, `GridLookUpEdit`, and `SearchLookUpEdit` controls can automatically filter their data sources based on a value in another lookup.

Use the secondary lookup's [CascadingOwner](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.LookUpEditBase.CascadingOwner) property to specify the primary lookup. Lookups use an internal algorithm that identifies a key field in a data source. The algorithm checks the names of data objects, the key attributes, and the data type of the primary keys. The algorithm is based on a common naming convention of key fields (for example, `ID`, `Key`, and `OID`).

Use the [CascadingMember](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.Repository.RepositoryItemLookUpEditBase.CascadingMember) property to manually specify a key field of the secondary lookup if the lookup's algorithm cannot identify a key field. Use the `;` character to delimit field names in a compound foreign key field.

Read the following help topic for additional information: [Cascading Lookups](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/116018/controls-and-libraries/editors-and-simple-controls/lookup-editors/cascading-lookups).
